# tailwind-and-boots
(-:

This is a simple quick proof of concept that takes the Bootstrap JS (via CDN) and Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and brings them together to have a simple dropdown button work. A few simple CSS classes were added to provide the basic show/hide Bootstrap is expecting.  Those classes were added to the HTML as styles in this example HTML but that was only done to keep the example simple.

I'll see what other's think and consider adding in the other JS features that Bootstrap offers out of the box.  Maybe even some basic Tailwind utilities... for the example above I only added the basics to ensure things stay "utility first".
