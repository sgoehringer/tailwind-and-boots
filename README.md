# tailwind-and-boots
(-:

This is a simple quick proof of concept that takes the Bootstrap JS (via CDN) and Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and brings them together to have a simple dropdown button work.

A few simple CSS Classes were added to provide the basic show/hide features that Bootstrp is expecting.  Those have been added as styles in this example HTML but that was only done to keep the example simple.
